# Titanic-example-data-analysis
Titanic example is an accessible approach to start the learning of Data analysis by using Python

Indeed, many data sets that exist are, by and large, still somehow difficult for me to start since I don't have a solid python coding skills.
I tried to use a comparatively small data to present a comprehensive use of data analysis codes in Python, basically, seven parts.

Here is the index of my codes
1. 

2. 


3. Statistic Analysis of Tickets.py
run the code and we could get the result as shown below:

Statistics of a set of tickets of survivors in Titanic disaster：

the mean is：91.99
the range is：504.28
the variance is：9964.24
the standard deviation is：99.82

Statistics of a set of tickets of victims in Titanic disaster：
the mean is：65.98
the range is：263.0
the variance is：4260.61
the standard deviation is：65.27

4. The result of the current value of one ticket.py is:

delete abnormal value 56.5

delete abnormal value 133.65

delete abnormal value 120.0

delete abnormal value 151.55

delete abnormal value 89.1

delete abnormal value 73.5

delete abnormal value 52.0

delete abnormal value 39.0

The average price(pounds) of tickets is 13.0

The face value(pounds) of one ticket is 1300.0
